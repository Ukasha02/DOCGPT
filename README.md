The main goal of this research was to overcome the gaps in medical knowledge seen in popular large language models like ChatGPT. We aimed to develop a specialized language model that offers more accurate medical advice.



We accomplished this by customizing and enhancing the large language model meta-AI (LLaMA) with a substantial dataset of 50,000 patient-doctor conversations from a popular online medical consultation platform. These dialogues were meticulously cleaned and anonymized to ensure privacy. 



Fine-tuning the model with real-world patient-doctor interactions greatly enhanced its ability to comprehend patient needs and deliver informed advice. By enabling the model to autonomously retrieve information from trusted online and offline sources, we noticed significant improvements in the accuracy of its responses.
